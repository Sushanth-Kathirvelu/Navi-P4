## Home Credit Default Risk
Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.

Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience; Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.

This is a Kaggle Challenge. The link to the Challenge is as below.
