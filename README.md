## Home Credit Default Risk
Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.

Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience; Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.

This is a Kaggle Challenge. The link to the Challenge is as below.

## Approach 
   
This project features two end-to-end approaches taken to solve the Kaggle challenge 'Home Credit Default Risk'. The first approach is using features created manually and the second approach is using an automated feature creation tool. The results of both these methods are compared and it is found that automated feature engineering can create superior features, in a shorter amount of time.

Training models: <br />
* Gradient Boosting Machines(GBM)
* RandomForest
